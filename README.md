# rust-mmr-sample

Repurpose chapter 1 of the "Programming Rust" book into making a bar chart based on a series of numbers.

Given a csv file with a number as a string in the fourth column, make a very simple pixel bar chart in the specified output file.

# How to run
cd into the `rust-mmr-sample` dir and run `cargo run example.csv example.png`, this should produce `example.png` again.

How `example.png` looks:
